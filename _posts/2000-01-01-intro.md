# **DITCH YOUR BANK**
## *Your Step by Step Guide to Un-Banking (finding financial freedom through the future of money)*
## *Even if you've only got $5 in your pocket or your filthy rich*

Hi,  I‚Äôm unbankme.io (link on keybase.io).  By now you‚Äôve probably heard of Bitcoin, the world‚Äôs first crypto currency.  You‚Äôve probably heard of it, perhaps you‚Äôve always wanted to look at it, but thought it was just nerd money or just for shady markets‚Ä¶.  I was kind of in the same boat, until my bank made it obvious that they don‚Äôt work for my best interest‚Ä¶  

I used to think that once you got to the point where you had an offshore bank account that meant that you had made it‚Ä¶.  Now, i look at banks and bank accounts the same way i used to look at my grandfathers old car, as antiques‚Ä¶  

**They nickel and dime you, they destroy your privacy and they are insecure‚Ä¶.**

The last straw was when i had to cash a check from overseas into a non-european country and was told by a major bank that it would take 2 Months to clear, the same exact week i was also charged 20eur to pay an 80e bill‚Ä¶..

No, I‚Äôm not some broke bum nor am i unemployed . I‚Äôm just like you, unless your a banker üòâ

# **Banking is a dying Industry**

Banking is a crazy business, you give them your hard earned money to hold; only to have to ask them to use it again and then get charged for every aspect of using it‚Ä¶.  

## **All for a measly .01%**

It was starting to suffocate me, i researched every way i could and finally wrapped my head around the crypto-currency lifestyle‚Ä¶

**What would you say if i told you that; i can show you how you can ‚Äúbank‚Äù better than the Rockefellers, with more security than a bank vault all while being able to spend it on a debit card‚Ä¶**

Honestly, financial freedom is amazing.

# Crypto-currency is nothing short of a revolution‚Ä¶  

**For over 1 year now, i‚Äôve been unbanked and loving every minute of it‚Ä¶  I‚Äôve discovered a world where my money works for me‚Ä¶**
